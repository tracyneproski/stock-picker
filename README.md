# Stock Picker
This parameter takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day and returns a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.

**Parameters**

Array

**Returns**

Array

Problems
-
Create a method that calculates the best day to buy and sell stock based on an array of prices per day. Days start at 0.

What I used
-
Ruby arrays, while loops, and index lookups

What I learned
-
In the process of trying to iterate, I learned about .product, but also that loops just takes some
math. Once the loops part was done, the rest was pretty smooth.
